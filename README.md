## Overview
Surepass esign web sdk can be consumed in two ways. You can add it to your flow of esing and then expect a redirect at the url you passed while you were initialising the token or you can use a event driven approach where you can open it in a new tab(mobile devices and desktop) or in new window(desktop) and use callback function to move forward based on sucess or failure of esign.
